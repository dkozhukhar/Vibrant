decreasing timer

different terrain for levels?
powerup maxing for weapons should do something

map with blocks
  - spatial void blocks
  - time change blocks
  - out of map blocks
  - energy gain block?
  - life regain block?

  trap should be a bomb

remove speed powerups? or turn faster once speed powerup is taken

ArcOfDream suggests more discernible powerups in the minimap


  Experiments on MMO player:
  - likes it because it's fast and remembers Asteroids
  - did not found how to catch powerups at first
  - did not read help
  - did not understand english
  - took a trap as a first powerup
  - stopped the game after 5 min ("is there anything else to find out?")
  - wonders about the objective
