  Experiments on MMO player:
  - likes it because it's fast and remembers Asteroids
  - did not found how to catch powerups at first
  - did not read help
  - did not understand english
  - took a trap as a first powerup
  - stopped the game after 5 min ("is there anything else to find out?")
  - wonders about the objective
